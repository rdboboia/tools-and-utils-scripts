# PC Shutdown scheduler
Scripts to schedule and cancel scheduled shutdown.

# Description
This is a very old "trick" but I still find it useful to this day.

Most useful usecase is when you want to let you PC cool down before shutting it off, but you don't want or have the time to wait around.
With this script you just schedule the shutdown and forget about it.

Also, if a shutdown was scheduled by mistake or you want to keep using the PC after you scheduler the shutdown you can use the additional script that cancels the scheduled shutdown.

# Configuration
The default time to shutdown is 15min (900s). This can be changed inside the scheduler script as needed (time must be in seconds).

The comment (the part within double quotes) should be editted accordingly for consistency purposes, but it's not a requirement for the script to work.
